Second to the [VSCODE](https://code.visualstudio.com/) text editor. The next developer tool is a good command line interface and although VScode has a built-in terminal I prefer to use [Windows Microsoft Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) for its customizable user interface, multiple tabs and its intergration with Windows Subsystem for Linux. This will ultimately allow us to leave one tab open running a service like the PHP development server, Gulp or Jekyll and seeing complilation errors for Sass or Jekyll as we save our code while also running other arguments like git, npm, composer, etc in another tab. The following is a quick how-to on getting up and running with Windows Microsoft Terminal by downloading its GitHub release, installing and launching it all from Powershell.
