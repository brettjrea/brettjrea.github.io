### Skills

My time spent and experience with computers and programming plus the intention to understand it all has lead me to have a deep vast overall knowledge, more recently though I've tried to focus specifically on Windows, Linux and modern web technologies.
I'm most proficient with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Linux scripting, as well as there subsets, like sass or jQuery. This page will left arranged with more details and specifics soon.
